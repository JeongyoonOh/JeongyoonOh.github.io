# Hi, I'm Jeongyoon Oh  
### PhD Candidate in the School of Building Construction at Georgia Tech

My research bridges **risk management in the built environment**, including **infrastructure, construction, and buildings**, with **data-driven and AI-enabled methods**.  

A core focus is on developing **decision-support methods** to proactively address risks spanning **cost, schedule, safety, energy, environmental performance, and human factors**.  

Building on this foundation, my work is expanding toward **AI-enabled approaches** for the built environment, where **large language models (LLMs)** can support areas such as **risk identification, construction management processes, and design optimization**.  

This line of research aims to **enhance decision-making across the project lifecycle**.
